-Goals-

With the base of the mod published featuring just one barbwire Baseball Bat, i want to expand upon this furthur and make a mod 
that lets people have a more interconnected relationship with their bat in zomboid, a way for more recreational customization.

And by that i mean

-the ability to craft a base wooden bat with
3 Planks
2 Woodglue
1 Leather Strips

1 Saw (any)
1 Hammer
Carpentry 2


-the abilty to create a metal (aluminum) baseball bat
1 Aluminum
1 Metal Pipe
1 Scrap Metal
1 Leather Strips

1 Propane Torch
1 Welder Mask
Metal Working 2


-the ability to furthur Paint each bat a specific color
1 (decided color) paintcan
1 Paint Brush
1 (Aluminum || Wooden) Baseball Bat

however nail & barbwire will still be limited to only wooden bat
Yet again tho, i could make rebar pieces in the aluminum bat :D

Overall this will need to be broken down and subsized into different sections that i will be working on slowly overtime and updating.
If someone is reading this expecting something, i am a busy highschooler whos also on the swim team so i will not get ALOTALOT of time, i just so happened
to be graced by thanksgiving weekend (week basically) to work on this bat.

If you are reading this, thank you ;D
